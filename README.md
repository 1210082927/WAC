UE4 Visualization Plugin - Windows Audio Capture (WAC) is an Unreal Engine 4 plugin that captures live audio from the windows default audio device and analyse it to frequency values. 

Practically you can create any audio visualisation through Unreal Engine's BP system by adding custom nodes that react live with your windows audio.
